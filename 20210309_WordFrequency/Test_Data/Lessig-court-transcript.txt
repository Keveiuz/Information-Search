no
in the supreme court of attorney general washington d c the united states
wednesday october the above entitled matter came on for oral argument before
the supreme court of the united states at a m
appearances lawrence lessig esq stanford california on behalf of the
petitioners
theodore b olson esq solicitor general department of justice washington d c
on behalf of the respondent
we ll hear argument now in number eric
eldred v john d ashcroft mr lessig
oral argument of lawrence lessig on behalf of the petitioners
mr chief justice may it please the court petitioners are
before you this morning challenging congress s sonny bono copyright term
extension act which extended the term of subsisting and future copyrights by
years petitioners submit such a blanket extension of existing terms exceeds
congress s power under the copyright clause and it violates the first amendment
now the government has responded to petitioners argument in a way that betrays a
simple but fundamental confusion the government has argued as if petitioners had
advanced a general theory of the copyright clause or a general constraint under
which congress must operate that is a mistake this case is about limits to an
enumerated power it s not about general power of congress to exercise its copyright
authority petitioners have advanced a particular interpretation of the only express
limits in the copyright clause designed to give those limits meaning
mr lessig i ll tell you what bothers me about your position
and that is that congress has extended the term so often through the years and if
you are right don t we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of time i
mean this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act
justice we do not believe that the very first act extended
terms at all speaking technically which for a lawyer means speaking accurately
the act did not extend a federal term the act granted a term for works
that already existed in precisely the pattern that the english parliament had done
in the statute of anne in and that the english parliament did with monopolies
general monopolies in the statute
but there have been a number of extensions since
that s right
even if you can get over the first hurdle
that s right that s the important hurdle and we d like to
jump that first but the other ones justice you re right in and in
congress extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the strongest form of the
test that we have advanced those extensions however were never challenged in any
court and certainly not considered by this court
well doesn t that itself mean something mr lessig the fact
that they were never challenged perhaps most people and perhaps everybody felt
there was no basis for challenging them
well mr chief justice it s absolutely true that this case
is here because of a fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes the
framers limitations on the copyright clause much more significant this is the
first time i can remember where this court has been pointed to changed circumstances
as a reason to reaffirm the framers values because for most of this period mr
chief justice the only people who were regulated by copyright law under the
copyright act would have been commercial publishers primarily and now for the
first time the scope of this exclusive right has expanded because of the changed
technology of the internet to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity
that never would have been imagined before now it s not the case that the earlier
extensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds in fact melville nimmer
in the consideration of the act suggested they were plainly under
well i m talking about court challenges not academic
challenges
that s right there is no court challenge
mr lessig your theory as i understand it regardless of
changed circumstances or not your basic theory which on your argument would have
been appropriate at any time historically is that there has at least got to be the
possibility of a kind of a causal connection between the extension and the promotion
or inducement for the creation of some subsequent work but why is that any more
plausible a reading of the promotion clause than simply a reading that says the
promotion clause requires that there be a general scheme in place which overall
tends to promote or induce and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the
that at the discretion of congress the period of protection is extended from time to
time why do you require why do you say the clause has got to be read by this
kind of specific causation theory as opposed to a kind of systemic theory of
promotion
justice souter the reason is exactly related to the point i
began with that this is a case about limits and not about discretion if it s not
the case that this court
no but that s i mean that s the issue in the alternative reading
that s right
and why is it a limit case rather than a discretion within a
general scheme kind
that s right
of clause
because if this court does not adopt a reading of the form
we ve offered then there is no limit to the ability of congress to extend
subsisting terms
do you say the same thing for scope this case is about
duration but congress from time to time in fact you mentioned
yes
the expanded applications of copyright and congress itself
extends the scope from time to time
would you make as far as say translation rights that didn t
exist before the same argument
i
why or and if you wouldn t why not
i no justice ginsburg we would not and the reason is
again related to the method we have adopted to interpret limited times we have
not said that promote the progress of science is a general and independent
constraint on the copyright clause authority we ve said it must be looked to to
interpret the scope of limited times and unless retrospective extensions are
forbidden it will eviscerate the meaning of limited times that does not occur in
the context of the scope of exclusive right nor in the context of the power to
secure if that s
could we then go back to justice o connor s question to make
that very specific if we agree with you does that mean that we would in
principle have to hold the extension unconstitutional i mean in
congress extended the term from years renewable once to life of the author plus
years now they re extending it life of the author plus if the latter is
unconstitutional on your theory how could the former not be and if the former is
the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous
justice breyer under our theory as we ve advanced it you re
right the act would be unconstitutional whether this court would apply such a
holding in this case to that act is a question that would have to be resolved under
the retrospective
maybe we ought to find another theory then is there any
justice the theory which would advance the aim of limiting
times in a way that is enforceable is only applicable in the case that we brought
before you here to the act and would not necessarily be applicable under the
act for the reasons the government has offered we would not advance this
argument but the government has offered an argument in a parallel case that
suggests a distinction between the act and this case that s not been briefed
here it s been grounded in their claim that the treaty power creates some special
power we wouldn t advance that claim but the point is there are a number of issues
that the act
in essence you think it s at least arguable that the act
had various positive aspects to it in terms of the purpose of the copyright clause
that this act lacks
that s certainly true and we also believe that for the
reasons averted to by amicus aol in this case and the reasons you ve just suggested
the disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases ryder and
reynoldsville casket company would be sufficient to fit it within the quote
severe disruption exception to the retrospectivity
well i suppose implicit in the argument that the act
too should have been declared void and that we might leave it alone because of the
disruption is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in science and
the useful arts i just don t see any empirical evidence for that
justice we are not making an empirical claim at all nothing in our
copyright clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress
our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary to assure that what would
be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws
well perhaps i misunderstood i thought the whole thrust of
your is a great first amendment force silenced that s being thwarted
well the thrust certainly
i thought
that s the whole underpinning of your case
it s certainly the case that we are asserting in light of the changed circumstances
that the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is a fundamental
first amendment interest and that the first amendment values vital speech interest
at stake of this case is that the public domain be permitted as a source for
cultivating work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction
well but you want more than that you want the right to copy
verbatim other people s books don t you
we want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in
the public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be
justified under ordinary first amendment analysis or under a proper reading of the
limits built into the copyright clause
mr lessig on your first amendment argument i don t see where
the retroactivity prospectivity comes in because i follow your argument under
the copyright clause but if you re saying that the time is too long the public
domain should get this stuff sooner rather than later would you explain to me how
your prospectivity retrospective line fits into your first amendment claim mr
lessig justice we ve argued that it would be inappropriate in this case for the
court to consider the prospective line until they decide whether the case whether
the prospective and retrospective is severable and we submit it s an easy case to
show that it s not
on the first amendment
yes
argument you re making that as i take it an argument
independent of it doesn t hang on your copyright clause argument
that s right i
that s right
and so let s just take let s say that was your only
argument in this case how does that tie into a retrospective prospective
distinction
well the strongest first amendment argument is about the
retrospective extension because of a fundamental change that occurs when congress
extends subsisting copyrights rather than when congress legislates prospectively
when congress legislates prospectively it has no way to know who s going to benefit
from its extension it is simply evaluating what the term should be prospectively in
a way that we presume this court should presume is legitimate under the first
amendment when it legislates retrospectively it is in effect looking at
particular authors and estates of authors who are before congress asking for this
extension and it s choosing between these particular authors and the public at
large now it may be that in exercising that choice in this case congress made an
objective valuation of who would be in the best position to advance the interests of
promoting the progress of science or any original
but you under your intermediate scrutiny test we would not
be hypothesizing what might have been in congress s mind your first amendment test
is a stringent one you have to have an important purpose and the means that you
use is necessarily tied to that purpose if you take that position i don t see how
you make the retroactive prospective line work
well the line comes from deciding what the first amendment
interest is and if this court heed the first amendment interest off of this
difference between selecting who gets the benefit of years of extension and just
simply legislating in a general way prospectively then this court could hold with
respect to the prospective that it s not even necessary to raise the intermediate
scrutiny in that context but again for ashwander reasons we don t think that this
court should address the prospective aspect of the ctea even under the first
amendment
even though congress s pattern has been to treat all authors
equally i mean the reason that it s been prospective and retrospective is that
people should be people who hold copyrights should be subject to the same regime
and not have some people who got their copyrights the week before the law passed
treated differently than people who got it the week after
well justice that certainly is the reason the government
offers for this pattern it of course doesn t explain actually what congress has
done and even in this case when a work has passed into the public domain then
there is precisely the same week before week after problem that you advert to that
extension does not extend to all subsisting works it only extends to all subsisting
copyrights so that line is already drawn in the practice that congress has adopted
but our point is the only way to assure
but congress has or you re not disputing that congress has
always made these extensions both retroactive and prospective
well in it did not in it granted the benefit of
its extension to a subset of all subsisting copyright holders
let s stick with
in
because that was what you said that s the pattern under
the ctea is identical to the one in the act
that s absolutely right yes so they have extended it to
both but our argument is unless this court draws a line about this extension then
for the reasons judge sentelle suggested below there will be no limit to congress s
ability to
judge sentelle did not deal with the first amendment as far
as i
that s right
recall
that s right
and so i m asking you perhaps i m missing it i haven t seen
where you get the prospective retrospective in connection with your first amendment
it seems that you re just saying there that years is an unreasonable is not necessary
yes
and it doesn t serve an important purpose
precisely actually we re not saying anything about the years in this case even
under the first amendment because we believe it s unseverable but
but i thought you were saying that if you accept the copyright
clause argument then you have a way in effect of devaluing the government s claim
of its important interest and important objective when you get to the first
amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis whereas if you don t accept the copyright
clause claim then in order to make the first amendment analysis we ve simply got
to say well gee is the promotion of useful art and so on more important than the
public domain and can we say that that allows a distinction between years and
years we re pretty much at sea so i thought your copyright clause argument was
necessary to give us some handle with which to deal with the first amendment
our copyright clause argument is certainly a way of framing
why extensions of subsisting terms cannot be seen to promote the first amendment
interest of speech at all
okay let s assume we don t for the sake of argument here
let s assume we don t accept the copyright clause argument do you have an
independent first amendment argument in your brief
yes of course we do
okay and it is tell me in a sentence or two what it is i
mean at that point i m where justice ginsburg is
yes the first amendment argument we ve argued in our brief
is with respect to the retrospective extension and the first amendment argument is
that needs to
no but that s the copyright clause argument and it seems to
me you re saying okay we then apply that in first amendment analysis which allows
us to make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument if we don t accept the
copyright clause retrospectivity argument
yes
then what is your first amendment argument
that s right i m sorry justice what i m saying is not that
it s the retrospectivity that makes the first amendment argument troubling i
mean that drives our first amendment argument all i m saying is we have addressed
the retrospective portion of ctea and so i m saying in the retrospective portion of
ctea you would apply ordinary intermediate first amendment review and you would
ask
well this court really has not if you say that the
copyright clause is not violated i don t think there are examples where this court
has then resorted to first amendment analysis to invalidate the same act
well
i mean this would be quite a new proposition
well justice o connor the first amendment is always an
independent limitation on what otherwise would be legitimate exercises of
congressional authority so this
yes but the framers seem adopted these two things at the same
time
that s right
in effect
that s right and if
and i think there are not to have examples that i can think of
where we have said well we ll analyze it under the copyright clause but if that
fails we ll turn to the first amendment
justice that s right if only we had the framers copyright
before us because of course again remember the exclusive right the framers spoke
of was the right to print and publish it didn t include the derivative rights it
didn t include the display rights and it certainly
right it has expanded very much and they also envisioned a
very short term and i can find a lot of fault with what congress did here
that s right
because it does take a lot of things out of the public
domain that one would think that someone in congress would want to think hard
about
that s right
but having done that it s very difficult to find the basis in
the constitution for saying it isn t a limited term it s longer than one might
think desirable
right
but is it not limited
well if it is limited then there is no limit to the ability
of congress to extend subsisting terms and that fundamentally destroys the
objective that the
the rule against perpetuities might jump in there at some
point
right and we submit the framers had something very different
in mind than the rule against perpetuities the point is if this is permitted then
there is no limit to the ability to extend terms and that is precisely contrary to
what the framers had in mind when they worried about this problem originally what
was the problem they were solving it was as this court stated in graham
well i could agree with you in terms of policy that this
flies directly in the face of what the framers had in mind absolutely but does it
violate the constitution
well if it flies in the face of what the framers had in
mind then the question is is there a way of interpreting their words that gives
effect to what they had in mind and the answer is yes
well you know certainly what is happening in the country
today in the way of congressional under the commerce clause is totally different
than what the framers had in mind but we ve never felt that that was the criterion
what the framers thought of there weren t steamboats there weren t
railroads
that s right
we ve said there was a general grant and that congress was
free to run with it in many respects
in many respects mr chief justice but as this court has
also said there are limits to what congress can do under the commerce
clause
but isn t
can i ask you about one of the limits just focusing on the
copyright clause and the progress of science and useful arts in your view does
that is that limited to encouraging creativity by authors and inventors or does
it also include the distribution of materials that might not otherwise be
distributed like old films and so forth
we re happy to adopt a broader interpretation of what promote
the progress is about within the general framework that the framers established in
light of the english practice which was a quid pro quo the ability to facilitate
distribution
so that if the quid pro quo is that we can facilitate
distribution of some old film by an additional monopoly grant you d think that s
permissible
so long as the grant is conditioned upon the distribution so
long as the grant
in other words you could have right now if congress
decides to have a law and this law is going to give copyrights in the bible
shakespeare ben jonson and the reason they do it is that they think that that
would lead publishers to produce those and distribute them and they re right they
will okay in your view that s perfectly constitutional
no that s the view of the government s justice breyer my
view is
well i thought that was the question you were getting and i
thought you were saying i must have misunderstood i thought you were saying that
was constitutional
no what we were saying is if congress wants to permit
restoration of films for example an issue that s been well briefed here congress
can say if you restore the film then the restoration gets a copyright so long as
it satisfies originality as outlined in feist and it gets a copyright for a period
of time but this court s opinion in graham and in feist made clear that it could
not extend copyrights to works in the public domain the government doesn t concede
that but we stand on that as a way of understanding why this court
so your answer to justice stevens is no they cannot give a
copyright purely for purposes of dissemination to publishers is that right
no
oh all right
they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of
distribution to publishers
they would need to satisfy all of the implied limitations
that this court has expressed in the context of this the most carefully limited
clause in article i section it is one of the
mr lessig the clause says congress shall and suppose
congress decides in this expanded world of ours that it s going to make certain
changes and other changes from our treaty partners suppose it well the germans led
the fight for years in the european union we ll go with that but we re going
demand says fair use now why couldn t that fit within the promotion of
knowledge
justice ginsburg we have no quarrel with the objective of
harmonization fitting within the promote the progress of science understanding
subject to constitutional limitations if france adopted a rule that said you
couldn t grant copyrights to hate speech we could not harmonize with that rule
consistent with our first amendment and similarly as mary beth peters testified
before congress ours is the only constitution that has an express limitation on
terms that s got to mean something and if it means that we are limited in our
ability to agree with the europeans as they continually expand the term in light of
their own vision of what copyright is about then that s the meaning of a
constitutional restriction this court s interpretation of limited times could of
course eviscerate that term of any meaning but under the principle of enumeration
as this court has articulated it this court should interpret that clause in a way
that gives its terms effect in a simple way just as a limited addition print is not
a limited is not limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is printed
so too a limited term is not limited if each time copyright holders come to
congress they can extend the term
that s right
the analogy doesn t seem to work
that s right all that i m suggesting is here is a plain
meaning of the term that gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that
assures that in fact the limit is respected contrary to the government s
argument which in effect permits congress the power perpetually to extend terms
if i may reserve the remainder of my time
very well mr lessig general olson we ll hear from
you
oral argument of theodore b olson on behalf of the respondent
mr chief justice and may it please the court the
questions today especially the initial questions suggest one of the many
insurmountable obstacles to petitioners petition in position in this case that is
that the first congress explicitly gave copyright protection to the authors of any
books already printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing copyrights
thereafter in and and in numerous private copyright bills
and temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions
congress extended the terms of federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting
works as this court explained and some years ago in its burrows giles opinion
such constructions are accorded very great weight and as that court went on to say
when consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that
consistent construction by congress of its authority under the copyright and patent
clause now has lasted from the from the first through the congress
it has been sustained by justices of this court and early decisions of this court
it is consistent with what the law of england was from the statute of anne
yes but take one of the early extensions just extending a
an already granted patent to an inventor for an extra years how can that be
squared with the language of the provision maybe congress did it but maybe it
acted improperly when it did it
well the congress
and that s our question really
well that it seems to me that there may be this is
the clause itself is a very very broad grant it says the
do you view it as entirely a grant or do you think it also
contains limitations
well i think that to the extent that there may be
limitations justice stevens they are require considerable deference by this
court to the judgment of congress
well i understand that but do you i d be interested in
knowing do you think it does contain limitations
it contains the clause itself contains limitations
limited times authors exclusive rights and things of that nature i don t think
and the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that any substantive
limitations in the promote the clause what the framers were saying is we want to
give congress the authority to promote the progress of useful arts and sciences and
how did the example we just talked about a patentee giving an
extra years on his how does that promote the progress of science
well it may provide additional incentives for the
patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work with respect
to creative works like works of art books and that sort of thing it patentee
that there was a bargain in effect between the inventor and the government that at a
certain period of time it would become part of the public domain it seems to me
it s inconsistent with that
i m just concentrating on our and i m wondering how that fits
into the notion
it isn t inconsistent i submit justice stevens for the
congress to exercise its juris its responsibility under this broad grant of power
to determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an existing right
may benefit the public by continuing to have that right for an additional period of
time the same reason that congress same reasons that congress had when it
created the right in the first place it s not just the right
no the reason for the right in the first place was to
encourage invention
well but i we submit that specifically with respect to
the copyright clause but i think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at
all it isn t just the invention it isn t just the writing of the work and this
relates to the questions that were asked of my colleague a moment ago it includes
the dissemination of the work not necessarily
dissemination alone
not necessarily the dissemination alone
well no not don t say not necessarily i m for
purposes of my thinking about it i d like to know imagine we have just
dissemination
that something is already in the
that s correct the only justification for the extension
there is no other is dissemination of a work that is already in existence
i would not want to rule that out justice breyer for the
very reason
well i want to say do you think yes or no
well i think that it could very well be yes for the
reason that in the statute the congress specifically was aware of that there
were state copyright laws which didn t last as long as the federal statute several
of the states hadn t finished enacting those copyright laws and a couple of states
hadn t enacted them at all
so in your opinion in my example if you recall it
it s
your answer would be if congress tomorrow wants to give a
copyright to a publisher solely for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating ben
jonson shakespeare it can do it
it may
i hate to say may
well
because that really that s an important question
well because i don t think that a per i don t think
there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of congress
to congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial there may be
other constitutional provisions that come into play or there may be other existing
all right let me explain to you why it s important to me i
have a list this is an economic statute the harms that seem to be caused by it
the extension i ve listed as follows approximate numbers made up but magnitude
correct the existing copyright holders who survive their copyright survives
years who have already been paid on the numbers that were given about billion
or more will receive an extra billion that i take it is a harm their works
have already been created harm number the fact that people for the percent
of the copyrights that have no commercial value after years have to find the
copyright holder to put them in databases the cost of that on my numbers in here
made up at least a billion dollars or they can t find the people at all and get
permission an innumerable cost un valuable cost to people who want to use it
those are costs on the plus side i see uniformity dissemination and now you
tell me
well i also see compliance with international competitive
markets and the laws that are being adopted and the incentives
uniformity that s uniformity
well that s not just uniformity it s providing incentive
to people to publish here as opposed to publish in europe where longer terms might
be available there is an incentive to distribute existing works that may be
necessary it s the consistency that congress is promoting by saying to individuals
as they might have said when they enacted the copyright clause in the first place
we will not only give you years but if we change our mind tomorrow and think
that a better a longer period is necessary we re this is consistency but it s
also a matter of fairness and it s
why on the last point it s i ve counted that as zero
the reason i ve counted it as zero is it seems to me that the added value incentive
value to produce between life plus or life plus is zero it s carried out
as the economists do to three decimal points divide by for the probability of
your ever having such a work and you get virtually zero no difference between this
and a perpetual copyright
well i think that that s a very good illustration of why
the authority is granted to congress because if you are an year old writer that
may make a considerable difference in terms of what you decide to do
how could it
it may because you may if you have no incentive if
you know that go into the public domain sooner rather affect your judgment with
respect to
in i this is going to than later it may
it might also publisher what the publisher pays for
your prospective work justice breyer we the copyright clause incentive provides
incentives not just for not just to the creators but to the disseminators the
publishers the broadcasters the film companies
so you think say verdi othello verdi othello years
old the prospect of an extra years way down the pike would have made a
difference
well i think again that illustrates why the authority is
vested in congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these
affect whether the judgments because we re not talking about the effect on an
individual author or an individual creator what the framers of the constitution
were concerned about is a gross judgment with respect to what might generally
provide incentives to the population
but it is hard to understand how if the overall purpose of
the copyright clause is to encourage creative work how some retroactive extension
could possibly do that i one wonders what was in the principle difficult
principle given to congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that
would ever kick in
well that s a that is a question to say whether there
is any limiting when such a broad grant of power authority is that
well if it s a limited term as the constitution says is
there indeed any limit out there
what i submit well first of all even the petitioners
acknowledge that as far as prospective limits are concerned that isn t a judgment
that this court is being made to ask and in fact the petitioners acknowledge that
it isn t a judgment that this court should make so the only point that the
petitioners
well if congress says we re going to grant this copyright
indefinitely forever
that would seem
that violates the limited term does it not
i acknowledge that and anything that
in victorian england you could buy a box seat for years
there was serene complacency about their culture and god bless them but
i really think this is an important question and as
justice o connor points out if we have to ask what s the most plausible explanation
for this rule to reward existing vested interest or to stimulate former new works
it seems to me that it s probably the former
well
i mean we know that
it is well it let me say with respond in
response to both of those questions an unlimited time would violate the copyright
clause something that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would
violate the copyright clause but the framers specifically did not put in numbers
they had the opportunity to do that thomas jefferson suggested that a number should
be put in we submit that it would be even since the petitioners don t suggest
that it s an appropriate function of this court certainly in this case to pick a
number years or something of that nature but it is quite clear that congress
from the statute of anne we have years of history of congress thinking
that it continues to benefit the process not just of the productivity of the
creation of the work itself but the dissemination of it to provide
general olson you say that the functional equivalent of an
unlimited time would be a violation but that s precisely the argument that s being
made by petitioners here that a limited time which is extendable is the
functionable functional equivalent of an unlimited time a limited time that
years from now can be extended and then extended again and extended again why
their argument is precisely that a limited time doesn t mean anything unless it
means once you have established the limit for works that have been created under
that limit that s the end
well the framers had an opportunity to say immutable
unalterable unamendable they didn t use that they used the phrase limited term
which means then meant then and means now a certain specified
okay assuming
number of years under the statute
with the exception of a limitation which illustrates the
distinction between forever on the one hand and a definite number on the other is
there any limitation in the clause does the promotion does the preambular
recitation of promotion as such place a limit on it
i submit justice souter that there s no per se
limitation that if there is as justice scalia suggested for if it is true that
congress having specified years or years decides that doesn t work very well
because of the economies of other countries the parade of constraints on artists in
other countries the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed it
should be more years or more years later
yes but that argument would apply to new copyrights but to
extension of already existing copyrights your argument doesn t apply
it does apply justice stevens because
the work has already been created
the work has already been created but the artists that
are creating works day in and day out take into consideration the fact that congress
has decided there s an ease of administration
but for them they get the benefit of the longer term if you
don t apply it to an existing copyright i mean if you say you need years
because of changes in the economy to encourage works you grant for the future
but why does that making that apply to somebody provided him
we re not just because we re not just talking about the author
if we we re talking about
the constitution refers to the authors and the inventors doesn t it
they re certainly the prime actors in this scene aren t they
yes but all of the history of the development of these
clauses suggests that and this court has indicated in its decisions with respect
to copyright that the framers were concerned and the congress is legitimately
concerned not just in providing the spark of creativity but to make sure that
that s distributed widely and available and there may be many reasons why we re we
and that it gets into the public the expiration of the term
that was an part of the bargain
yes and what but the
definition of the term was a responsibility vested in congress because it has the
power the legislative history of the act itself suggests what was going on
here and suggests why the framers gave this authority to congress there were
numerous hearings there were testimony by the folks that represent the same
position as petitioners here as to why this shouldn t be done why it should be that
this done congress weighed as this court the phrase court used i think it was
in the feist case the delicate balance that was so difficult for congress
to
how
okay but you
what weighs in that balance because to go back for one
second in practical economic terms i gather the difference between a copyright
that lasts for years lasts for years lasts forever is probably
something less than on a penny i mean it s a penny on or
probably a lot less than that frankly so i can not only not imagine a person whose
decision to write would be governed by such a thing i cannot imagine a european who
would come to america to copyright his work for such a reason indeed i wonder why
that european wouldn t come anyway even if the term were years because if he
doesn t come he s not going to get protection
well the
i mean who are these people that are going to be moved by
that incentive
the as we described in our brief in pages through
i believe it is in our brief that the concerns about the limitation on
exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in europe is based upon the
country of origin of the work and the shortest time available so that there may be
differences and we describe that but that illustrates justice breyer the
difference between cents and cents and with respect to this particular
author who s this particular age or a particular author like melville whose works
weren t weren t didn t or schubert whose works weren t properly
appreciated or exploitable until many years after their death all of these
variations are quintessentially legislative judgments it would be very difficult
for the framers to have eschewed deciding years was a constitutional limitation
and for this court to say years is and again even the petitioners aren t asking
the court to make that judgment the petitioners are only saying that there shall be
a per se rule that the word limited times means unchangeable times
but there has to be a limit as you acknowledge perpetual
copyright is not permitted who is the judge of within that line who is the
judge of when it becomes unlimited is there in other words judicial review and
if there is what standard would this court apply to determine whether something
short of perpetual is still unlimited
well the issue before this court i hasten to say as i
said before is only whether once the congress makes that judgment it can ever
change it retrospectively the issue before this court is not whether in the
future a certain length of time would be appropriate that but the answer to
that justice ginsburg i submit is found in the necessary and proper clause and
this court s interpretation of the necessary and proper clause as to the extent that
this court would find or not find that the judgment made by congress with respect to
the implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in terms of the
achievement of the goals
okay and is your argument that we find and hold against their
retrospective because there is some at least plausible basis should so argument to
say that there can be a causal connection between the retrospective extension and
some benefit that can be traced to those particular works through the retrospective
extension like dissemination is that your argument
that is among our arguments justice souter
is it also your argument that even if you cannot trace that
kind or at least plausibly argue that there could be that kind of a causal benefit
that it would still be constitutional because you should judge the extension simply
as contributing to a general system one feature of which is that from time to time
there may be retrospective extensions and so long as that general system induces
the creation of works or the dissemination of works or the preservation of works
so long as the general system works there is no review no limitation on the
tinkering that can be done even retrospectively is that also your argument
i think that s a fair statement of an argument that we
have made and articulated in the brief
okay
that unless there is a the court is because the
circumstances change that we are living in an era now where piracy is a significant
problem there s question of administrative ease of administering a system where
copyrights may be different for one set of authors or different for another set of
authors there s changes that are taking place internationally so that what we re
saying is that not only could this court conceive of reasons why congress thought it
was accomplishing the objectives of this clause but that there are numerous
objectives that are entirely legitimate in
do you also argue that the necessary and proper clause alone
will justify the retroactive extension simply as a matter of equity
yes
that is that the copyright clause justifies the extension for
works not yet created but it would be enormously inequitable to have other authors
who put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection so the necessary and
proper clause now allows you to do the retrospective
yes justice scalia and the examples that are
can i ask you why is it enormously inequitable if they get
exactly what they were entitled to at the time they made the work
the implicit promise that
i mean they have some right to expect that they will be
you know an additional grant later on
i think that s not an unreasonable expectation at all
justice stevens because that was the premise of the
that is the way it s always been done there hasn t been any
copyright extension that hasn t applied to subsisting work
that s
but there was one justice breyer brought up ben jonson so
this case doesn t involve works that are already in the public domain
that is correct
this is subsisting copyrights
that is correct
so
but why wouldn t it
why why not
why wouldn t it if the equity argument under the necessary
and proper clause justifies extension of the copyright for those whose copyright
will expire tomorrow if it s not extended in order to put them on parity with those
getting copyrights for new works why doesn t it apply to the copyright the holder
of the copyright that expired yesterday
you could arguably you could conceivably make that
argument justice souter but there is a bright line there something that has
already gone into the public domain which other individuals or companies or
entities may then have acquired an interest in or rights to or be involved in
disseminating
and if you don t
this is a rational
if you don t draw the line there then ben jonson certainly
gets recopyrighted
well the difficulty
if we re just looking for a bright line the line that they
suggest between unexpired patents and copyrights and brand new ones is also just as
bright
oh i concede that it s a bright line but it s a bright
line that would have
except congress chose this one and didn t choose the other
one that s
congress
basically you re saying the presumption ought to be in the congressional judgment
about how to draw the line as well as in how long a line to draw
i agree and this court has we re not just talking about the
judgment of the congress of the the
congress in this is the way the statute of anne was written this is the
way the state copyright laws were written when this country became a nation this is
the way the copyright statute the number of
well of course the original statute was replacing a bunch of
state statutes or state rules partly common law partly statutory that they had
kind of a mixed up legal situation and there was an interest in having one uniform
rule for the first time around
well there was an interest in having a uniform rule and
that s precisely why the framers created the copyright clause in the constitution
but there was copyright protection in some states there wasn t copyright protection
in other states and what we know from the decision of this court in the wheaton
decision is that there was not a common law copyright in existence this court
explicitly held that now the petitioners make this quid pro quo to draw the line
as well as in how long a line
i agree and this court has just talking about the
judgment of the congress the congress in this is the way the argument
that somehow implicitly the initial copyright statute was saying to people you
get a copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you have that simply does
not make any sense there is no language and it s a relatively late discovered
argument because it sees its full
i want you to finish that but i want you to go back to the
i have one question on the equity principle are you i want you to finish
i wasn t finished but i m happy to come back
go ahead no no you finish
well i was going to say no language whatsoever of
preemption abandonment abrogation or exchange in the copyright but compare
copyright act but compare that to thefirst there s patent act under the same
clause where there is that exchange there the other thing as this court has said
there is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which
would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing now
why i mean i think you have a point on this equity
principle i wonder is there any review there that is suppose you have a statute
as this one arguably is where percent many billions of dollars of benefits
are going to the existing holders of copyright on grounds of equity and the effect
of the statute in eliciting new works is near zero i mean that would seem where
this equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat and is there any
can we say something like that or does congress have total leeway in respect to
well it
who they want to give the money to basically
justice breyer it s conceivable that the court might do
that if that situation was present but it s not remotely the situation here we
have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent generally speaking with
copyright terms which exist in the european union our principal competitor and in
connection with international treaties we have a copyright term that s consistent
with the concept of the creator plus the creator s first generation heirs we have a
copyright term remember which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that
were added to the period between creation and publication so that the limited
number of years in the first the and the statute were the number of years
plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication so we
don t have anything remotely like that in this situation we have a process which
as you suggested or one of the questions suggested is may not have been the
policy that you as a member of congress would have supported you might have made
the balance that delicate balance that this court has referred to in another way
but that is something that congress through its ability to gather facts and make
balances is quintessentially capable of doing and that is where the framers vested
the responsibility and what this statute does is to favor if at all the creator
with respect to the utilization of these rights as opposed to the person who wishes
to copy the creator that s an entirely rational distinction for congress to make
thank you
thank you general olson mr lessig you have minutes
remaining
rebuttal argument of lawrence lessig on behalf of the petitioners
general olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the
structure of the government s argument it is that there is no effective limit on
congress s power under the copyright clause now were this the first time this
court had considered congress s copyright authority that might be a plausible
argument but the very first time this court ever struck down a law of congress as
exceeding article i section power was in the context of the copyright clause we
have years of history of this court making sure that the limits both express
and implied in the copyright clause have some meaning the feist opinion very
clearly sets out the implied limits a per se limit for originality for the reasons
justice breyer was trying to get me to say the harper as well as graham set out
very clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public
domain those limits make no sense under the reasoning the government has offered
the government s reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong
now we offer a simple way to make this clear express limit make sense and that is
precisely the understanding we suggest that existed in the only precedents
that existed in were precedents of setting a term and then when parliament was
asked in and to extend it they rejected it and as amicus historians
said they rejected it because as a pamphleteer described it that would be
effectively a perpetual term now this delicate balance that the government
invokes justice breyer let me give you the numbers the delicate balance is that
under the most reasonable assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our
interest rate of percent as the amicus economists note at page note of their
brief the current term gives authors percent of the value of a perpetual term
now that might be a delicate balance that they give the author percent and
the public percent but in my mind that s delicate in a very different sense of
that term thank you very much
thank you mr lessig the case is
submitted
whereupon at a m the case in the above entitled matter was submitted
