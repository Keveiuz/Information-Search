so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date johno
this is what uh
this is a meeting for me
um
eva
bhaskara and i did
did you add more stuff to it later
um why
um
i don t know
there were like the you know and all that stuff but
i thought you you said you were adding stuff but i don t know
uh no this is
um
ha
very nice
um so we thought that
we can write up
uh
an element
and for each of the situation
nodes that we observed in the bayes net
so
what s the situation like at the entity that is mentioned if we know anything about it is it under construction
or is it
on fire or something happening to it or is it stable
and so forth going all the way
um
f
through parking
location hotel car restroom
riots fairs strikes or
disasters
so is this is a situation are is all the things which can be happening right now
or what is the situation
type
that s basically just specifying the the input for the w what s
oh i see y why are you specifying it in
um
just because it forces us to be specific about the values
here
and also i mean this is a what the input is going to be right
so we will uh
this is a schema this is
well yeah i just don t know if this is th l what the does this is what java bayes takes as a
no because i mean if we
bayes net spec
i mean we re sure gonna interface to
we re gonna get an document from somewhere
right and that document will say
we are able to we were able to observe that w the element
um of the location that the car is near
so that s gonna be
um
so this is the situational context everything in it is that what situation is short for shi situational context
yep
so this is just
again a an schemata which defines a set of possible uh permissible
structures
which we view as input into the bayes net
right
and then we can r uh
possibly run one of them uh
transformations
that put it into the format that the bayes n or java bayes or whatever wants
yea are you talking are you talking about the the structure
well it
i mean when you observe a node
when you when you say
the input to the v java bayes
um hmm
it takes a certain format right
which i don t think is this
although i don t know
no it s certainly not this
nuh
so you could just couldn t you just run a
yeah
yeah
to convert it into the java bayes for format
yep
that s
that s no problem but
i even think that um
i mean once once you have this sort of as running as a module
right what you want is
you wanna say give me the posterior probabilities of the go there node
when this is happening
right when the person said this the car is there it s raining and this is happening
and with this you can specify the what s happening in the situation and what s happening
with the user
so we get
after we are done through the situation we get the user vector
so this is a
so this is just a specification of all the possible inputs
yep
and
all the possible outputs too
so we have um
for example the uh go there decision node
which has two
elements going there
and its posterior probability
and not going there and its posterior probability
because the output is always gonna be
all the decision nodes and all the the a all the posterior probabilities for all the values
and then we would just look at the eh struct that we wanna look at in terms of if if we re only asking about one of the
so like if i m just interested in the going there node
i would just pull that information out of the struct
that gets return that would that java bayes would output
um
pretty much yes but
i think it s a little bit more complex
as if i understand it correctly it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes
so when we
input something
we always get the uh posterior probabilities for all of these right
so there is no way of telling it t
not to tell us about the eva values
yeah wait i agree that s yeah use oh uh yeah
so so we get this whole
list of of um
things and the question is
what to do with it
what to hand on
how to interpret it
in a sense
so y you said if you i m only interested in whether he wants to go there or not then i just look at that node
look which one
look at that struct in the output right
yep
look at that struct in the the output even though
i wouldn t call it a struct but
well i well it s an structure that s being res returned right
oh mm hmm
so every part of a structure is a struct
yeah
yeah i just uh i just was abbreviated it
to struct in my head and
started going with that
that element or object
i would say
not a that s not what i was trying to k though yeah
yeah
and um
the reason is
why i think it s a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is
um
so
the uh
let s look at an example
well w wouldn t we just take the structure that s outputted
and then run another transformation on it that would just dump the one that we wanted out
yeah w we d need to prune
right
throw things away
well actually you don t even need to do that with d can t you just look at one specific
no
yeah exactly the
xerxes
allows you to say u just give me the value of that and that and that
but we don t really know what we re interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result
so the person said
um
where is and so
we want to know
um
is does he want
info
o on this or know the location
or does he want to go there
let s assume this is our our question
sure
nuh
so
um
do this in perl
so we get
let s assume this is the output
so
we should con be able to conclude from that that
i mean it s always gonna give us a value of
how likely we think i it is that he wants to go there and doesn t want to go there
or how likely it is that he wants to
get information
but maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate
so does he wanna know where it is or does he wanna go there
he wants to know where it is
right
i i i tend to agree and if it s
if
well now y i mean you could
and i if there s sort of a clear winner here
and um
and this is pretty uh
indifferent
then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to
just know where uh t uh he does want to go there
uh out of curiosity is there a reason why we wouldn t
combine
these three nodes
into one smaller subnet
that would just
basically be
the question for we have where is is the question right that would just be info on or location
based upon
or go there a lot of people ask that if they actually just wanna go there
people come up to you on campus and say where s the library
you re gonna say y you re gonna say g go down that way
you re not gonna say it s it s five hundred yards away from you or it s north of you or
it s located
well i mean but the there s so you just have three
decisions for the final node that would link thes these three nodes in the net together
um
i don t know whether i understand what you mean but again in this
given this input we also in some situations may wanna
postulate an opinion whether
that person wants to go there now
the nicest way use a cab or so s
wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there because he wants to
visit t it or whatever
so it n i mean a all i m saying is
whatever our input is we re always gonna get the full
output
and some
some things
will always be sort of
too not significant enough
wha
or i or i it ll be tight you won t it ll be hard to decide but i mean i guess i guess the thing is
yep
uh
this is another smaller case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty which makes me think bayes net should be
the way to solve
these things so if you had if for every construction right
oh
you could say well there here s the where is construction
and for the where is construction we know we need to l look at this node
that merges these three things together
mm hmm
as for th to decide the response and since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with we could have a finite number of nodes
say if we had to y deal with arbitrary language it wouldn t make any sense to do that because
mm hmm
there d be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence
mm hmm
but since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff
so basically the idea is to f
to feed the output of that
belief net into another belief net
yeah so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief net
but why why why only those three why not the whol
well i mean d for the where is question
so we d have a node for the where is question
yeah but we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the where is
and the where how do i get to or the tell me something about
is food not allowed in here
you can come in if you want
yes it is allowed
as long as y you re not wearing your h your h headphones
alright just a second i ll be back
well i do i see i don t know if this is a good idea or not i m just throwing it out
but uh it seems like we could have i mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant
into the where is node answer
mm hmm
yep
node
thing
stuff
and uh
i mean
let s not forget we re gonna get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse things right
so
tell me the location of
nuh
or where is located
we u
at nuh
yeah i know but the bayes net would be able to the weights on the
on the nodes in the bayes net would be able to do all that wouldn t it
mm hmm
here s a k
oh
oh i ll wait until you re plugged in
oh don t sit there sit here
you know how you don t like that one it s
oh do i not
that s the weird one
that s the one that s painful that hurts it hurts so bad
i m h i m happy that they re recording that
that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it
it s a painful painful microphone
i think it s th called the crown
the crown
what
yeah versus the sony
the crown
is that the actual name
mm hmm
the manufacturer
i don t see a manufacturer on it
you w
oh wait here it is h this thingy
yeah it s the crown
the crown of pain
yes
you re on line
are you are your mike o is your mike on
indeed
so you ve been working with these guys you know what s going on
yes i have
and i do
yeah alright s so where are we
excellent
we re discussing this
i don t think it can handle french but anyway
so
assume we have something coming in a person says where is and we get a certain we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine
an an and and our and our
did you just sti did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea
no
and um
i m not drinking tea what are you talking about
oh yeah sorry
let s just assume our bayes net just has three decision nodes for the time being
these three he wants to know something about it he wants to know where it is he wants to go there
in terms of these would be wha how we would answer the question where is right
we u
this is i that s what you s it seemed like explained it to me earlier w
we we re we wanna know how to answer the question where is
yeah but mmm
yeah
no i can i can do the timing node in here too and say
well yeah but in the s uh let s just deal with the s the simple case of we re not worrying about timing or anything
we just want to know how we should answer where is
and um
and
go there has two values right go there and not go there let s assume those are the posterior probabilities of that
mm hmm
info on has true or false and location so he wants to know something about it and he wants to know something he wants to know where it is
excuse me
has these values
and um
oh i see why we can t do that
and um in this case we would probably all agree that
he wants to go there our belief net thinks he wants to go there right in the uh whatever if we have something like
yeah
mm hmm
this here
and
this like that and maybe here also some
you should probably
make them out of yeah
well it
something like that
then we would guess aha he our belief net
has s stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is than actually wants to go there
right
that it doesn t this assume though that they re evenly weighted
true
like
i guess they are evenly weighted
the different decision nodes you mean
yeah the go there the info on and the location
well d yeah this is making the assumption
yes
like
what do you mean by differently weighted they don t feed into anything really anymore
or i jus
but i mean why do we
le
if we trusted the go there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones then we would conclude even in this situation that he wanted to go there
so in that sense we weight them equally
makes sense yeah
right now
so the but i guess the k the question
but
that i was as er wondering or maybe robert was proposing to me
is
how do we d make the decision on as to which one to listen to
yeah so the final d decision is the combination of these three so again it s it s some kind of uh
bayes net
yeah sure
so then the question i so then my question is t to you then would be
so is the only r reason we can make all these smaller bayes nets because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions
cuz oth if we re just taking arbitrary language in we couldn t have a node for every possible question you know
a decision node for every possible question you mean
well i like in the case of yeah
in the ca any piece of language we wouldn t be able to answer it with this system b if we just h
cuz we wouldn t have the correct node basically w what you re s proposing is a n where is node right
yeah
and and if we and if someone says you know uh something in mandarin
so is
yeah
to the system we d wouldn t know which node to look at to answer that question right
yeah
mmm
so but but if we have a finite what
i don t see your point what what what i am thinking or what
we re about to propose here is
we re always gonna get the whole list of
values and their posterior probabilities
and now we need an expert system or belief net or something that interprets that
that looks at all the
values and says
the winner is
timing now go there
uh go there timing now
or the winner is info on
function off
so he wants to know something about it and what it does
nuh
uh regardless of of of the input wh regardle
yeah but
but how does the expert but how does the expert system
know how who which one to declare the winner if it doesn t know the question it is and how that question should be answered
based on the k what the question was so what the discourse the ontology the situation and the user model gave us we came up with these values for these decisions
yeah i know but how do we weight what we get out
as which one i which ones are important
so my i so if we were to it with a bayes net we d have to have a node
for every question that we knew how to deal with
that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question
mm hmm
does that make sense
yay nay
um i mean are you saying that what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation or are we just dealing with arbitrary language
we
is that your point
well no i i guess my question is
is the reason that we can make a node f or so lemme
see if i m confused are we going to make a node for every question does that make sense or not
for every question like
every construction
hmm
i don t not necessarily i would think i mean it s not based on constructions it s based on things like uh there s gonna be a node for go there or not and there s gonna be a node for enter view approach
wel
w
so someone asked a question
yeah
how do we decide
how to answer it
well look at
look
face yourself with this pr question you get this
you ll have y this is what you get
and now you have to make a decision what do we think
what does this tell us
and not knowing what was asked and what happened and whether the person was a tourist or a local because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these
posterior probabilities
yeah
what what we need is a just a mechanism that says
aha
there is
i just don t think a winner take all type of thing is the
i mean in general like we won t just have those three right we ll have uh like many many nodes
yep
so we have to like so that it s no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say
because there are interdependencies right
the uh
uh no so if if
for example the go there posterior possibility is so high um
uh w if it s if it has reached reached a certain height then
all of this becomes irrelevant so if even if if the function or the history or something is
scoring pretty good on the true node true value
wel
i don t know about that cuz that would suggest that i mean
he wants to go there and know something about it
do they have to be mutual
yeah do they have to be mutually exclusive
i think to some extent they are
or maybe they re not
cuz i uh the way you describe what they meant they weren t mutu uh they didn t seem mutually exclusive to me
well if he doesn t want to go there
even if the enter
posterior proba so
wel
go there is no
enter is high and info on is high
well yeah just out of the other three though that you had in the
hmm
those three nodes the d they didn t seem like they were mutually exclusive
no there s no but
it s through the
so th s so yeah but some so some things would drop out and some things would still be important
mm hmm
but i guess what s confusing me is if we have a bayes net to deal w another bayes net to deal with this stuff
mm hmm
you know
uh
is the only reason so
i guess
if we have a ba another bayes net to deal with this stuff the only r reason
we can design it is cuz we know
what each question is asking
yeah
i think that s true
and then so the only reason way we would know what question he s asking is based upon oh so if let s say i had a construction parser and i plug this in i would know what each construction the communicative
intent of the construction was
mm hmm
and so then i would know how to weight the nodes appropriately in response
so no matter what they said if i could map it onto a where is construction
ge
mm hmm
i could say ah
well the the intent here was where is
right
and i could look at those
yeah
yes i mean sure you do need to know i mean to have that kind of information
hmm
yeah i m also agreeing that a simple
pru
take the ones where we have a clear winner
forget about the ones where it s all sort of
middle ground
prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner
yeah because that would be the easiest way
we just compose as an output an mes message that says
go there now
enter
historical information
and not care whether that s consistent with anything
right
but in this case if we say definitely he doesn t want to go there he just wants to know
where it is
or let s call this this look at h
he wants to know something about the history of so he said
tell me something about the history of that
now the e but for some reason the endpoint approach
gets a really high score too
we can t expect this to be sort of at point
three three three point three three three point three three three right
somebody needs to zap that
you know
or
know
there needs to be some knowledge that
we
yeah but the bayes net that would merge
i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er my and my microphone
so then
the bayes net that would merge
there that would make the decision between go there info on and location
would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff
yep
i mean it i
yep
does that make sense
yep it s sort of one of those that s it s more like a decision tree
if if you want
you first look o at the lowball ones and then
yeah i
yeah i didn t intend to say that every possible
there was a confusion there k i didn t intend to say every possible thing should go into the bayes net because some of the things aren t relevant in the bayes net
for a specific question
like the endpoint
is not necessarily relevant in the bayes net for where is until after you ve decided whether you wanna go there or not
mm hmm
right
show us the way bhaskara
i guess the other thing is that um yeah i mean when you re asked a specific question and you don t even
like if you re asked a where is question you may not even look like ask for the posterior probability of the uh node right
cuz that s what i mean in the bayes net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node so i mean
you may not even bother to compute things you don t need
um
aren t we always computing all
no
you can compute uh the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes given
some other nodes but
totally ignore some other nodes also
basically things you ignore get marginalized over
yeah but that s that s just shifting the problem
then you would have to make a decision if it s a where is question which
yeah so you have to make
yeah
decision nodes do i query
yes
that s un
but i would think that s what you want to do right
mmm
well eventually you still have to pick out which ones you look at so it s pretty much the same problem isn t it
yeah
yeah it s it s it s apples and oranges nuh
i mean maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance
computational time so either you
mm hmm
always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes and then prune
mmm
the ones you think that are
irrelevant
or you just make a p
a priori
estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those
yeah
so basically you d have a decision tree query go there
if k if that s false query this one if that s true query that one and just basically do a binary search through the
i don t know if it would necessarily be that uh complicated but uh
i mean it w
well in the case of go there it would be in the case cuz if you needed an if y if go there was true you d wanna know what endpoint
was and if it was false you d wanna d look at
either lo income info on or history
yeah
that s true i guess yeah so in a way you would have that
also i m somewhat boggled by that hugin software
why s that
i can t figure out how to get the
probabilities into it
like i d look at
mm hmm
it s somewha it s boggling me
alright
well hopefully it s fixable
ju
oh yeah yeah i d i just think i haven t
it s there s a
figured out what the terms in hugin mean versus what java bayes terms are
um by the way are do we know whether jerry and nancy are coming or
so we can figure this out
they should come when they re done their stuff basically whenever that is
so
what d what do they need to do left
um
i guess
jerry needs to enter marks but i don t know if he s gonna do that now or later
but uh if he s gonna enter marks it s gonna take him awhile i guess and he won t be here
and what s nancy doing
nancy um she was sorta finishing up the uh
calculation of marks and assigning of grades but i don t know if she should be here
well or she should be free after that so
assuming she s coming to this meeting
i don t know if she knows about it
she s on the email list right
is she
mm hmm
because
basically what
where we also have decided prior to
this meeting is that
we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together
sometime this week again
and finish up the uh values
of
this
so we have
uh
believe it or not we have all the bottom ones here
well i
you added a bunch of nodes for
yep
we we we have actually what we have is this line
uh what do the uh
right
structures
hmm
do so the the the
for instance this location node s got two inputs
that one you
four inputs
hmm
four
those are the bottom things are inputs also
oh i see
yeah
that was
that makes a lot more sense to me now
yep
cuz i thought it was like that
one in
stuart s book about
you know the
alarm in the dog
u yeah
yeah
or the earthquake and the alarm
sorry yeah i m confusing two
yeah there s a dog one too but that s in java bayes isn t it
right
maybe
but there s something about
bowel problems or something with the dog
yeah
and we have all the
top ones
all the ones to which no arrows are pointing
what we re missing are the
these where arrows are pointing where we re combining
top ones
so we have to come up with values for this and
this this this and so forth
and maybe
just fiddle around with it a little bit more
and um
and then it s just uh
edges
many of
edges
and um we won t meet next monday
so
cuz of memorial day
yep
we ll meet next tuesday i guess
yeah
when s jerry leaving for
italia
on on friday
which friday
this this friday
oh this friday
ugh
this friday
as in four days
yep
or three days
is he how long is he gone for
two weeks
italy huh
what s uh what s there
well it s a country
buildings
people
but it s not a conference or anything he s just visiting
pasta
hmm
right
just visiting
vacation
it s a pretty nice place
in my brief uh encounter with it
do you guys oh yeah so part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back
um so
oh i think we should disappoint him
yeah you or have a finished construction parser and a working belief net and uh
that wouldn t be disappointing
i think w we should do absolutely no work
for the two weeks that he s gone
well that s actually what i had planned personally i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work and i do nothing
and then i sort of
oh yeah that sounds good too
sort of bask in in your glory
but uh i do you guys have any vacation plans because i myself am going to be
um
gone but
this is actually not really important just this weekend we re going camping
yeah i m wanna be this gone this weekend too
ah
but we re all going to be here on tuesday again
looks like it
yeah
then let s meet meet again next tuesday
and um
finish up this bayes net
and once we have finished it
i guess we can
um
and that s going to be more just you and me
because bhaskara is doing probabilistic
recursive
structured
object oriented
uh
killing machines
reasoning machines
yes
and um
killing reasoning what s the difference
wait so you re saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting or just
uh
us three working on it or or
the whole group
and we present our results
our final
definite
so when you were saying we need to do a re run
of like
h what
what like just working out the rest of the
yeah we should do this th the upcoming days
this week
so this week yeah
when you say the whole group you mean
the four of us and keith
and ami might
ami might be here and it s possible that nancy ll be here
yep
so
yeah
because th you know
once we have the belief net done
you re just gonna have to
explain it to me then on tuesday how it s all gonna work out
you know
we will
because then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know
defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it and then
hook it up to some
fake construction
parser and
that you will have in about
nine months or so yeah
yeah
and um
the first bad version ll be done in nine months
yeah i can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse i mean this is pretty um i mean i i i hope everybody uh knows that
these are just going to be uh dummy values right
which
where the
which ones
s so so if the endpoint if the go there is yes and no then go there discourse will just be fifty fifty
right
um what do you mean if the go there says no then the go there is
i don t get it
i don t u understand
um
like the go there depends on all those four things
yep
yeah
but what are the values of the go there discourse
well it depends on the situation if the discourse is strongly indicating that
yeah but uh we have no discourse input
oh i see the d see uh specifically in our situation and are gonna be uh yeah sure so whatever
so so far we have
is that what the keith node is
yep
and you re taking it out for now or
well this is
this i can i can get it in here
all the s are
i can get it in here so th we have the uh
um
sk let s let s call it keith johno
node
johno
there is
an
somewhere printed
there you go
yeah people have the same problem with my name
yeah
oops
and um
does th th does the go b before the or after the
oh in my name before the
yeah
good
cuz you kn when you said people have the same problem i thought cuz my goes after the uh e e e the v
people have the inverse problem with my name
i always have to check
every time y i send you an email
a past email of yours to make sure i m spelling your name correctly
yeah
that s good
i worry about you
i appreciate that
but when you abbreviate yourself as the basman you don t use any s
basman yeah it s because of the chessplayer named michael basman who is my hero
you re a geek
it s k i
how do you pronou
how do you pronounce your name
eva
eva
yeah
not eva
what if i were what if i were to call you eva
i d probably still respond to it
i ve had people call me eva but i don t know
no not just eva eva like if i u
take the and s pronounce it like it was a german
which is
yeah
um no idea then
voiced
what
it sounds like an there s also an in german which is why i
i
well it s just the difference between voiced and unvoiced
yeah
as long as that s k i mean i might slip out and say it accidentally that s all i m saying
um
that s fine
yeah it doesn t matter what those nodes are anyway because we ll just make the weights zero for now
yep
we ll make them zero for now
because it who who knows what they come up with
what s gonna come in there
and um
then
should we start on thursday
and not meet tomorrow
sure
i ll send an email
make a time suggestion
wait maybe it s so that
that that we can that we have one node per construction
cuz even in people like they don t know what you re talking about if you re using some sort of strange construction
yeah they would still c sort of get the closest best fit
well yeah but i mean the uh i mean that s what the construction parser would do uh i mean if you said something completely arbitrary it would f find the
mm hmm
closest construction right but if you said something that was completel er h theoretically the construction parser would do that
but if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever
n people wouldn t have any idea what you were talking about
mm hmm
like bus dog fried egg i mean
you know
or if even something chinese for example
or something in mandarin yeah
or cantonese as the case may be
what do you think about that bhaskara
i mean
well
but how many constructions do could we possibly have
nodes for
in this system or in r
no we like when people do this kind of thing
oh when p how many constructions do people have
yeah
i have not the slightest idea
is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very uh sort of s abstract things
every noun is a construction
so it s like in the thousands
the yeah
any any form meaning pair to my understanding is a construction
so
and form u starts at the level of noun or actually maybe even sounds yeah
phoneme yep
and goes upwards
until you get
the ditransitive construction
and then of course the c i guess maybe there can be the
s
can there be combinations of the dit
discourse level
yeah
constructions
the giving a speech construction
rhetorical constructions yeah
yes
but i mean
you know you can probably count
count the ways
i mean
it s probab yeah i would s definitely say it s finite
yeah
and at least in compilers that s all that really matters as long as your analysis is finite
how s that how it can be finite again
nah i can t think of a way it would be infinite
well you can come up with new constructions
yeah
if the if your if your brain was totally non deterministic
then perhaps there s a way to get uh
infin an infinite number of constructions that you d have to worry about
but i mean in the practical sense it s impossible
right cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons
yeah
so the best case scenario would be the number of constructions or the worst case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons
well two to the power of the number of neurons
right
but still
finite
no wait not necessarily is it
we can end the meeting i just
can t you use different var different levels of activation
across uh
mm hmm
lots of different neurons to specify different values
um yeah but there s like a certain level of
there s a bandwidth issue right yeah
bandw yeah so you can t do better than something
turn off the mikes otherwise it gets really tough for the tr
