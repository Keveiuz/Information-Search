transcript of interview with nathan hole
do you identify with a certain group of people who are you
that s a scary question as for the first not specifically i
identify myself as being in between group of people kind of like being one foot in
each water or like linked to different groups
and which groups are those
well you would need to define group
well lets say culture what cultures do you identify with and
why
cultural groups being european not french because both of my
parents arent french with a certain warmth towards american and russian culture the
warmth could be described as family attachement
but not in the cultural sense as in you feel national pride do
feel a national attachement to american or russia as in political movements
traditions etc
probably because these are two cultures representative of my
childhood the mother and father figure well childhood memories passport
what aspects exactly do you identify with each culture country
transmission of tradition the cultural backround of europe the
passion and emotionnal side to russia like my soul feels russian i feel european
with a zest of americanism
how exactly do you define that emotion and passion
so how do you define yourself as being a citizen of the world
free spirited and universal
what exactly is a citizen of the world how do you define that
someone who has been raised with multiple nationals and that
adopts a more international perspective someone who does not have strong
nationalist pride and feels more connected to people in general
and so in your opinion do you believe that being from two
different backgrouns has helped you achieve this identity
well not only being from two different backgrounds but being
born in a third one my father is american my mom is russian but i was born in
france
how did those two happen to reside in france
circumstances allright i ll say it
yes please
my mom after living in russia at that time ussr moved to
germany with her family finishing her high school when she was around she
decided to move to paris not liking life in germany at that time my father was
working closely on projects regarding the construction of oil pipelines in the
caucasus and flew constantly to russia being between the us and russia he needed to
stay somewhere in between and decided to live in paris they met randomly in monaco
at that time and decided to stay in france before i was born they would constantly
travel to russia and new york
do you know what language they spoke together did your father
speak russian
english russian so yes it would depend on circumstances my
dad spoke russian since he was a kid having a russian nanny
did he speak any other languages
english french chinese fluently and a couple more my father
was born and raised in china till age
can you tell me about your father
so the reason i consider myself citizen of the world is
because i come from a family that has moved every generation my father was born and
raised in china his family being american originally from new york however with
the war with the japanese and the advent of mao tse tung rise all of their wealth
was confiscated by the state and they were encouraged to leave my father then took
a boat to the us where he pursued high school and college my mother was born and
raised in russia with german origins germans migrated to russia in the century
because the queen at that time needed skillful workers for her ambitious tastes she
lived on the border of the oural the mountains which bring to siberia in the
artic circle she then moved to germany with her family it seems that i am
continuing that family trend of hours of moving abroad after all i was born and
raised in france but recently moved to new york although part of my roots reside
here it is still life changing when i was little i always had the feeling i
wasn t as everyone else because i never spoke french at home i would speak russian
and english at home with both my mom and dad while using french at school now most
of the kids i was friends with have double nationalities or are pluricultural
do you remember feeling different as a child because of this
this progressively forged me into having this idea that i have
nothing in me that is french but my roots lie in europe i think my generation is
one of the first of our time to have a european sentiment feeling like they are
part of a european culture of course i m not saying that the majority of my
generation feels that way we are a minority but the whole feeling isn t merely
avant garde anymore its foundation is solid and expanding this feeling of being
pluricultural is hard to digest during your teenage years you feel like being
inadequate not part of everything but the more you grow and gain in maturity the
stronger those foundations which gives you global perspective great asset in our
times furthermore having a more of a global cultural identity has prompt me to
travel a lot and discover other cultures which in time strengthens the feeling of
being part of humanity as a whole to understand that right and wrong can be a
cultural social or religious view in the end it all depends from which angle you
perceive the subject from
what do you think has made it expand globalization so during
your childhood do you have any memories of your first language which one was first
tricky question i don t have any memory whatsoever of what my
first language was my dad always spoke to me in english my mom always spoke to me
in russian had both russian and american nannies and to keep the language going
i d be taken care of during summer by american students
did you visit russia ever as a child
because russian was a language i would only use with family as
a child when i was i thought russian was a family language my parents and i
would fly from time to time to russia
do you remember what that was like what were your impressions
of russia
once when i was around upon getting there everyone spoke
russian so i turned to my mom and told her we have a really big family
that s cute
hard to describe my impressions of russia
well what do you remember about it
i still have the ussr vision of russia i remember tanks and
army on the highways the cold and snow in a big park
did that seem really strange to you compared with france
well not really when you are young you do not really take
those things into account you more or less take them for granted
when was the last time you went there
all i remember is that at that time because there were soldiers
all around i thought russia was a mighty country
in or
oh so you were about years old
indeed
would you go to visit family
no most of my family moved to germany i would go there for
business purposes my dad had an office there my mom and i would accompany him
i see working with the russian pipelines
oil pipelines in the caucasus at that time it wasn t merely
russia it was the soviet union that s what i meant everything was centralized in
moscow
so is your family religious at all your last name sounds very
jewish
not exactly spiritual would be the more appropriate term i
have jewish origins from my father s side but he was never religious
so neither of your parents was very religious
my mom is catholic and would go every once in a while to church
like on christmas or easter i was baptized in moscow in an orthodox church then did
my communion in a catholic church
i see so you were actually brought up with some religion
yeah then i followed kabala briefly i certainly do have a
judeo christian religious background i was actually influenced by my classmates
though kind of embarrassing story but one of my friends at that time told me about
the communion getting presents and all since i wasn t really brought up through
religion i decided to do it because i would get gifts i think a lot of children are
like that my family taught me spirituality not dogma
what kind of spirituality can you explain
well that is why today i would be somewhere in between deism
and agnosticism spirituality is a vague term to express the fact that you do
believe in more than just physical you believe the interconnectivity of everything
in the universe from the atom to the universe
like buddhism
you believe that there may be a greater purpose well buddhism
is somewhat similar except i have more of a judeo christian root
you just don t stop at naming any religion in particular as
yours
well for instance the commandments whether written or not
by god are good values they are moral standards applicable to any society whether
religious or not
that s true we shouldn t have to follow them just because we
are afraid of going to hell
let s just say that i don t believe i need religion as i mean
to feel connected to the rest
i believe my connection to everything is solely individual and
based on my own experience everyone should have the choice of using whatever means
necessary to channel himself whether religion philosophy and so on furthermore
having a more of a global cultural identity has prompt me to travel a lot and
discover other cultures which in time strengthens the feeling of being part of
humanity as a whole to understand that right and wrong can be a cultural social or
religious view in the end it all depends from which angle you perceive the subject
from
finding spirituality doesn t just come automatically are there
any life changing experiences in particular which have lead you to these beliefs
i lost my father when i was thirteen this brought unpleasant
turmoil to my family and changed my life radically during my teenage years i had
trouble identifying with a specific group because i felt so different i had lost a
parent i was multicultural had no religious ax yet wasn t atheist either which got
me really lost and confused after finishing high school i needed to find my roots
and decided to go on a backpacking trip to china to find out more about my father s
past now china being so different from where i grew up made me understand that the
world isn t just one vision but infinite visions of reality in a sense by
traveling there not only i found out more about my father discovered a place and
tried new thing this trip kind of cleared my head and i realized that we were all
part of a whole as different as we are from then on i decided to go backpacking
every summer i then went to chile bolivia and peru where i spent most of my time
living with locals hence discovering fully culture and traditions went to vietnam
eastern europe i m proud to say that i have friends of all nationalities religion
and color
could you tell me about a specific moment or situation on one
of your trips that have left a mark on you this can be a person you ve met too
during my trips i was lucky enough to meet very interesting
people as well as encounter odd situations we started drifting around and instead
of staying in chile went north to bolivia now at that time the country was on the
brink of civil war most of the roads were closed and bus drivers would tell us that
driving during the night was unsafe and extremely dangerous yet we managed going on
and got to la paz the capital now originally we were making way to go to peru
while seeing a couple of amazing landscapes but like i was saying the country was
in civil war rroads were obliterated but broken pavement while angry mobs ruled
the city the ever growing presence of military rendered the situation uneasy and
one could see burning cars illuminated roads as giant iron candle sticks now being
a foreigner and going through such a stage in a countries history is extremely
enriching because these inequalities however serious they can be in your country of
origin are more strongly demonstrated in a poor country one can finally grasp how
the world is filled with conflictuous passions
were you ever afraid
i wouldnt say i was afraid because we didnt encounter any
potential life threatening situations with locals the military were very suspicious
but most of the people we met told us we should leave immediatly because it is
unsafe general population is usually always friendly occasionally you would bump
into people that disliked foreigners but thats always a minority from there on we
headed to peru saw a couple of breathtaking if not life changing views let me
point out the fact that humanity has built such jewel across the world that merely
seeing thus wonderful masterpieces enables to see what potential we have not only
that but nature also has amazing treasures to share coming back to the original
story after hanging out in peru for a while we were bound to head back south
to eventually get back to our plane the only problem was we drifted so far away
that we started having financial issues furthermore we were in such remote areas
that no one could actually transfer us any money through western union or money
gram we literally had just barely enough to pay for buses so we started fasting
for now fasting while being constantly on the move with a bag on ur back
and under scorching heat was harder than expected during one of the bus rides
which was a bus ride by the way i started feeling dehydrated and nauseous i
started seeing stars and couldnt get up anymore actually my friend told me i turned
green so i got myself together and started begging for water in a bus filled with
peruvian farmers we were the only foreigners one of them shared his orange juice
with me this helped me greatly but the experience of having literally nothing and
having to beg for water and supplies was truly a horrible yet strong experience to
bear
yeah it must make you appreciative of what you have
it also stirs up the instinct of survival
where else have you traveled
i have travelled also to china vietnam mexico eastern
europe
what about people you met on your trips
i have met very interesting people on my trips the most
intriguing person i have met is during my vietnam expedition in i was waiting
for a friend to join me from thailand and had some time to kill so i decided to
visit ho ghi minh city formerly saigon and its surroundings now in vietnam there
are diverse religions such as buddhism christianity and the latter cao daisme now
cao dai is a religion which holds million worshipers throughout the world but the
actual root of it is in vietnam it is rather complicated to explain but it more or
less a combination of buddhism christianity and humanism the practice is mainly
inspired by buddhism but the belief in a certain divine order the all seeing eye
judeo christian with reincarnation their temples are usually extremely colorful
with blue ceilings very different from what we are used to seeing in the western
world i was visiting one of those temples enjoying the new scenery and started
talking to one of the monks after some platonic chit chat he asked me where i was
from so i cut the story short and told him i was visiting from france he then
asked me if i was interested to talk in french with one of the people there i
naturally accepted and followed the monk behind the altar towards the private
chambers i met up with a very old man probably in his it was hard to
understand him because the communist regime under ho chi minh cut his tongue off
let me remind you that communist regime heavily repressed any religious ideas and
concepts it turned out progressively that the man was more than merely a priest he
was the equivalent of what we would call the pope in the catholic church he started
showing all these letters from political personalities such as henry kissinger
jacques chirac the former president of france the queen of england australia s
prime minister i was literally amazed encountering such a prestigious man he was
so humble so human so far away from politics very down to earth if i may say now
having this opportunity and to talk about spirituality with someone so highly
respected in that part of the world was truly an honor he gave me some of his
written teachings which i brought back to paris with me not to practice my newly
discovered religion but to remember that moment in my life
so tell me how you feel about being half american
nothing specific i have always had a certain warmth towards
the us i m definetly not as patriotic as the average american and also may have
developed a more critical approach towards what america is living in new york is
great ive always wanted to spend some of my life in the us you have to understand
that although i was raised in france there are certain things that were passed on to
me as american culture for instance the fact of being able to celebrate halloween
within the us was something i really enjoyed i have always wanted to celebrate it
in the real surrounding
do people take you for an american or do they tell you that you
seem european
i feel more european culturally speaking however when i talk
with people and have random conversations they wouldnt know that they would come to
realize it when for instance they would talk about american football which i have
never watched or when i would randomly mispronounce a word that i havent used that
much before im not considered by americans as french either they dont really
comment on it thing is i know how a word sounds i just sometimes mispronounce it
and then auto correct myself people just consider me as a rare commodity an
american raised in europe
so do you identify more with french or americans
i don t identify at all with french because i m not i don t
even have a french passport
but you lived there your whole life
yes but those circumstances have given me a more european
feeling that a french feeling i am part of this generation of kids that have mixed
nationalities in europe and consider themselves as europeans
but you could easily get a french passport
yes but i wouldn t want it
why s that
i definitely come from france am used to eating habits but i
feel different than the average french mainly tax purposes but also because i am
weary of france and wanted to leave for a while
why are you weary of france
in my opinion france hasnt been evolving lately and its
stagnating views are leading it to its downfall and because it isnt turned towards
international careers france is very chauvinist and being multicultural isnt seen
as a high asset like in the states
why do you think that is so
hard to say but part of it is because france was once a great
country on an international level its greatness has been withering ever since and i
believe its people feel that way
