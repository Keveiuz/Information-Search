i would say between the ages of to years old it was a really big thing to go to the movie on saturday mornings
and one particular movie theater we went to they would show serials every saturday which were a continued story
so if you missed one saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you um wouldn t know what had taken place
so we would go every saturday morning
and also at this theater they gave prizes to different people
and one of the way they gave prizes was they would take big group photos and everybody and there were stairs going up to a balcony real wide stairs
and the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably or kids in the picture
and they d take the picture and then you would go back the next saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled or people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes
is that for real
that s for real
that really happened
and one time i can remember i think it was steve my brother um he and they would give treats like candy i don t even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give
but for some reason and i think this is really true he got ice cream sandwiches
like a box of ice cream sandwiches
and of course there s nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you re at a hour movie
they re going to melt
and another um that was in that was in high point nc
and then we moved to charlotte and we used to go to and i don t think its even still there i don t know if the building is or not but the dilworth theatre
i lived in the dilworth area and we would go to the dilworth theatre and i do remember that it cost cents to get a ticket to get in
and we would could go to the movie
we would get maybe cents each to go to the movie and i sound like i m years old
with those kinds of prices
um but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your your snack that you wanted
and there were several different choices
i don t ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until i was a teenager or in my adult life
but we would uh buy lollipops is what they call them now but we called them suckers and we would get often a cent sucker
are you making fun
no i love this story
and the cent suckers is what is referred to now as a tootsie roll pop
and we called them cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny
except these were cents because they had the tootsie roll in the middle
and there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker just because you couldn t eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long
and one other form of refreshment that we got which really embarrassed my mother because she didn t know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one saturday there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre
and my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this
we would go into the bakery and we would ask for
a nickel worth of scraps
and we didn t even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie
and what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking mistakes
so they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us
and that s all the stories i can remember about the movies right now
i do know that i did used to go the movie downtown at the carolina theatre
and when i was young it wasn t a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie
i mean my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back but today you wouldn t send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother you just wouldn t do it
and we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that
which is kind of sad that you can t do that anymore and it s not just because things are there re bad people in the world but it s too much traffic
you have to check everything about a movie check it out to see what the content is and just wasn t like that when i was growing up
also about that same time period in my life i guess again between seven and ten years old which seems to be what i remember most vividly my best friend uh was kathy josey and she was a next door neighbor also and we remained friends up until uh she was about and she passed away with cancer
but we we remained close friends
in fact we shared an apartment first apartment either one of us ever had
and when we were um little girls we used to play career girls
we did
and we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen
and we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up we sure did we got an apartment
uh huh
um kathy and i also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just it seems like i remember we both had like our mother s long skirts or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers
but we had kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother s and i didn t have the necklace
and it was really beautiful and i really really wanted one
so we only had the one necklace and we er we decided i don t know if it was jointly or if kathy was just extremely nice of whatever but she said i could wear it part of the time
and we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like minutes or minutes or whatever
and the way we decided who got to wear it first and this always kind of bothered me because i know kathy did this intentionally she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than i am
so it that became
a normal thing with us
whenever we only had one of something she would always say well i think the youngest one gets to do it or wear it or whatever first
and that just always stuck in my mind that in in our adult life i brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn t know anything about that and i thought to myself she does and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one
um also we did a lot of pretending and as i said we played career girls and the dress ups
and my sister and i used to pretend also and jill is about years younger than i am maybe two and a half and we used to play robin hood except we didn t have a maid marion we had a saretha i don t know where in the world that name came from
but we would switch playing robin hood one would play robin hood and one would play saretha
and saretha was the counter would be the same thing as maid marion and why again i don t know why we didn t use maid marion
but in my mind i can remember playing that like all day long
and we would go over to my grandparents and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and uh banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch
and it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or uh it could be a castle just do many things with it
um and when we were still living in high point in our back yard we had a huge i don t know i guess it was an oak tree but it was a really big tree but it was a climbable tree
and it had real large thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches
and that was another game that jill and i used to play we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant
and in the yard we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted um flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever
when i was a teenager an audrey hepburn movie came out called wait until dark
and i think i was probably or years old we were of driving age
and i had a group of girlfriends that i ran around with and there were golly there might ve been to of us who were good friends
everybody had their own best friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together
um and we would had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and i remember one of the girls betty belle her dad had a vw beetle and we d fit like girls in that vw beetle
did betty belle turn catholic
no huh uh
she didn t
no
so we went out one night to the movie but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to and i think the name of the place was the open kitchen and we didn t have chain pizza places like we do now like pizza hut and all that
this was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go
and we went to open kitchen and we would have eight or girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and i think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn t have money to leave tips
we would also drink water
so it wasn t a good situation for the waitresses but we had fun and we didn t even think about it
we just did what we could get away with
anyway that night we were gonna go see wait until dark and i think it was on at the manor theatre and i just remember when you have like or so girls going somewhere to the same place it s kind of a pretty much of a spectacle we re all in this long line and we re giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time
so we bought our tickets and we went into the manor theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat file all filed in
and i just remember seeing and i was sitting in a middle section i was not on an end so i had girls i knew on both sides of me
and i just remember that movie was had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it s nothing like these movies that are out today like scream and what is it
nightmare on elm street whatever it is where they re actual horror movies
this was uh a real intense um drama and just very scary kept you on the edge of your seat
and there was a scene in the movie i remember where every one of us and it wasn t just our group but so many people in the theatre they screamed out at one time
and that s really all i remember about that night it was just a lot of fun
and i really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that that i can remember going out with good friends
