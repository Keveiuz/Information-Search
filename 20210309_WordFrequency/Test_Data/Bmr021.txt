if you re popular
one two three four five six i m on seven
we re on
it s probably the
yeah
so i think we pre crashed so i think we re
pre crashed
so it should be a really short meeting i hope
uh agenda items number one i wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues what the heck are we gonna do about microphones
so uh i got passed on that the group doesn t like the
oh
uh crown mikes i do i l i think i find them very comfortable uh but it seems to depend on your head shape
who does
i do
yeah i do too
so you guys need to start going to the meetings
i see
yeah right
they don t work for me very well i much prefer these
that s right
yep um
yeah
me too
so do i
i prefer these but i don t mind using those
right
th those are intimidating
so apparently they they like
it has one good effect that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike
interesting
people who show up late have to use these so
um we should probably get different mikes so the question is the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more um
sony mikes
just two more of those um and that that s easy and that will certainly work
the other option is to try yet another mike
find one we like and potentially get six all the same
i have a question about this
are the auditory quality is it uh much different between this kind and the the fancy ones
um these are better if they re worn correctly
they are
those are better than the sonys
have you
yeah
yeah definitely
have you listened to to them
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i mean they re not a lot better but they are a little better
are they more directional the microphones as far as
um they re more directional a little better error uh noise cancellation and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth like this whereas that one to avoid breath noise you really have to put it at to the side
so you seem to get better signal with this one
the other thing is is it just a few people who don t like them in the group cuz
i don t know but you know in in sort of random polling
l liz liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them
they are ver
gosh cuz i much prefer them i think they re a whole lot multiple levels better
it seems a shame t to discard discard them if if they re better auditory quality and there re only a few people who dis who object
i mean so s
right
yeah that s why i was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in
well i mean that s the other option is that we could switch the form so it s more obvious the distinction between channel and mike um and then get
you know pretty
duplicates i mean there s no problem with that it s just what
hmm
should we get just more sony ones i hate the sony ones
which ones are those
b the one you re wearing because it it pinches
the one i m wearing oh
those
pinches the temples too much
oh
and
i mean so if you wear it sort of around the back it s not too bad
yeah
i hate it because it s hard to adjust the microphone i mean i spend all this time fumbling around with it and still not
yeah
but i
right
reasonable yeah
right
so i mean we could try another mike
but then we have the wiring issue and so i i don t know what to do what do what do people think
but the problem is again the the plug or
wh
the plug is proprietary so that s why i was saying getting more sony ones is trivial because we can just go out and buy them any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired
yeah
n now may maybe i just don t know this but um are the only two possibilities from sony the two that we ve tried or is there another
yes
so the only possibilities from sony are that one and the lapel mike
i see
oh i see
so this isn t sony this is crown the one we re wearing
isn t that something
and so we had these wired for us
oh i see
well it s it seems like right now if if u what they re complaining are those if we just got two more of these
and so
huh i remember that now
i think that s probably the right first step is just get two more immediately and have them available
yeah
and then they can just unplug those from the
right
and just make sure that you write down crown or sony on the mike number which i ll change to mike type or something like that
transmitter
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
it might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too cuz that would be an easy place for uh an error in the data
yep
for it to be forgotten
well it ll be me
it ll be whoever s setting up the meeting who fills out the key file so
it s just i m just thinking that if it d be yeah but i know but i mean to have the user fill it out wouldn t be as reliable as have the
it has the same potential for error as everything else
no no we definitely would not have the user fill it out it would be me chuck or liz depending on which meeting it is
good
perfect
perfect
so we ll de definitely go ahead and do that
how much is it just to buy the mike
couple hundred
really
yeah
is that more or less than you thought
it depends on how good the mike is
oh that s way more than i thought i yeah
oh
yeah
for one of these
well the crown ones were like two fifty i think those are like one ninety
god
oops
wow
but
is there any educational discount
yeah right
no
student discount
yeah good mikes are expensive so
and when i was at computer motion we used shure the ten a s and i think they were only like eighty bucks or something
mm hmm
yeah eighty or ninety for the shures so
yeah but they were they seemed pretty good
i mean the sony ones are expensive because they re proprietary so they can charge whatever they want these are expensive because they re quite high quality so
oh
right right
so we should buzz that out if we send the data to sony
ah come on
we should keep a list of things we re gonna bleep out and the conditions under which
well i m just joking
so you do not have to bleep that out i don t mind if sony knows my opinion so
hmm
um
also we re pro i wanna double check with morgan he did say yes before i went to japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless instead of the mix of wired and wireless and i think that s the right thing to do
so then all those red channels there would become wireless ones
and i m
yeah
yep
cool
yep
uh huh
four more wireless
um
and also i m gonna re probably replace the andrea mike with a shure but i ll test it uh sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the shure one really works cuz i have an extra shure in my office
the andrea mike
yeah
yeah apparently it s had some problems
that s causing problems yeah
which one is the andrea mike
it was over here sometimes
a wired one
the yeah a wired one
yeah it s uh
well if you re gonna go to all wireless
oh you mean in the meantime
this one
in the meantime right because uh
ah i see
yeah
it ll it ll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from sony anyway
yeah
i haven t in the meetings that i recorded s
so
it s always been at most six people so i ve never had to
oh really yeah
recently i haven t had to used any of the wired ones at all
i guess cuz everyone s been out of town probably over the summer it ll be the same cuz it tends to be less
yeah
fewer people
um
file
uh done with microphone issues i think
should we close the door
if you want
oh i m thinking i don t know about the acoustics that s that s all i was wondering about
and this way we can get a door slam in the uh in the transcript file
yeah
yeah that s right we gotta get the obligatory door slam
oh well no not quite a slam
there s some knocks
get a special phone for that
mm hmm
uh the door slam phone
i guess right the door slam phone
yeah
you have a special phone
no we could add one
oh we could add one yeah
and then we could have the phone phone
yeah
that s an idea
for for when the phone rings
um
uh file reorganization
this is something we were talking about before i left and saying we should probably wait until after i m back and now i m back so we should do that at some point so we should
get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else
can i can i just mention something
sure
um uh i think the file regards reorganization also um another issue there is disk space probably right um so
mm hmm
i know that the files that you ve been cutting up for us
f for the recognition experiments uh one way one really
mm hmm
brain
uh brain dead way of of of
not causing any trouble but saving disk space is to uh use the s the
sphere the nist uh program
to to encode you know to compress them
shorten is that the same as shorten
uh yeah but it does it s it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently
yeah
well you mean it s built into the because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools
so
y uh i guess but it
um
so it s just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools
well it s
well like hhh
it s actually built into the sphere library that nist delivers so right
oh really i didn t know that
and actually s the sound tools don t understand that
for the
at least feacalc doesn t
at least feacalc doesn t so
well that s not a sound tool right
but since since these files are made to be used with the recognizer
uh and the front end uses the sphere library which in turn does this
transparently
um
uh that will be a quick and
quick and easy way to just uh get you know uh be able to use more
yeah
mm hmm
the other thing i could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything
to my eighteen gig disk which is local
but that s gonna be only temporary
well
i mean i don t know
i mean you should do that too
probably but but as you do that you can also just run the
yeah it is kind of a temporary solution
to shorten everything
well actually the th what you do is you run
oh now i have another use for the
the way i recently used it and there might be better ways so the program s called
mmm
and i think the type y you say um
i think dash and then there are different
different encoding methods but if you wanna use the shorten one you say d minus shorten
and then the old
uh wavefile and the new
wavefile and then oops and then i check you know if this works so you can use the
the shell and operator or something
then i just move the
new wavefile to the
you know to the old
right
wavefile and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to
mm hmm
decode it on the fly
and that
that just saved my butt because i actually was running on a different experiment i had
segmented
i was processing the whole switchboard two corpus which is two hundred eighty hours of speech
and i was noticing as i was
almost finishing the processing that i was running out of disk space
mm hmm
and and so
i uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them so i
shortening everything on the fly
while this other thing was still going on i was run i was running this this thing
you had another process running that was shortening it yep
wow wow
and low and behold i gained three g three gig of space and um you know
wow
did you have to re nice one of the processes to make sure that shorten
no no actually it was fast enough this is very fast this this really runs quickly and that s
wow
that must have been suspenseful
watching the disk meter
that was very suspenseful that was that was the most excitement i had all weekend uh uh boy it uh came out just fine so
to be
you know what would be a
u i don t know if this would mess other things up but
it seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around what would be easier would be like pointers
the list yep
you know lists like original wavefile start end
start end
this is
yep the way feacalc calc does it
right the the only reason we do this is because the the front end doesn t have a way to to um
go into a l a longer file with indices
um so i i suppose
and segment on the fly
someone could try to put a hack like that into the
it would be easy
it wouldn t be hard at all someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time
so
but there s also some i guess
and that way we wouldn t have multiple versions floating around about the only difficulty with that is if it s compressed
then you really do have to decompress it first
that s true
right because the pointers are
y you don t know how much it s comp
well is there is there is there a nist routine which
it doesn t compress it by a fixed amount
exactly right right right right right
can seek
in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices
i don t think so
and yeah i mean that it
no no i mean if you
th the the the
if you can operate on the full
if you don t have to segment it then there would be less of a reason to do the compression because you don t have that wasted
right
that extra copy so
right we i mean the original switchboard files are not compressed right so we could leave those as they are
yeah
right
well i mean it just depends on how much disk space is a problem i mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it
right
but
i mean the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions
just silences yeah
and if you have you know twenty channels and only five speakers then it s
that s true
mm hmm
well assuming you d yeah assuming that you then off load the original
yeah
switchboard files
so
mmm
yeah
well it seems like just shortening them is a good short term solution so we don t have to do any coding
yeah yeah
yeah
but i think kind of we ve had there was a big disk crash when you were gone and
so
no it was i was still here it was the day i left
oh was that the day you left
that s suspicious
he did it on purpose
yeah
leave to japan the day the disk crashes
no if i if i had done it on purpose i would have timed it right after i left
but um yeah so chuck helped me out in uh r
regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings for like six meetings so i think they re split up even further it s kind of even more disorganized now since
mm hmm
we moved some of the meetings to different directories
they re on a different disk even right
are they
i think you didn t you expand them to on abbott
no you the ones that
oh different ones
you the ones that you put them on when you put them on
i don t remember where i put them now
i think you put them on so
well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed
was it w with a with a meta disk allocation you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on were on the same sorry different partitions of the same physical disk
physical disk
mmm
and it s conceivable i mean i i don t i mean so um i was told that it s possible that that might have uh caused additional wear on it maybe caused it to to go bad sooner
well i think there was something else going on because uh dave johnson said that was getting accessed frequently and it shouldn t be
hmm
oh uh huh
right that data never gets touched because we write it once and then we never touch it again
well why not
oh sure it does
yeah after each meeting we copy the data to
except that
well i mean so the wavefiles or or anything at all because the transcripts are there as well
the wave files
i mean he was saying gigabytes
oh gigabytes i see
and so it has to be the wave files
yeah there was something weird about that
yeah that s right
yeah so i asked dave about it and he hasn t looked into it yet but we should definitely double check on it
yeah like like the same
meeting shortened files that we pull off of popcorn when we re done doing the recording
yeah
looked
to the backup software as if they had been written
you know every single night
every night
is that right
i for f you know a week in a row which is really weird
that s very strange i didn t realize that
wow
so at any rate so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we re gonna do and then when we re gonna do it
yeah
so i m not sure who isn t involved with that i mean certainly me chuck and jane anyone else care
and i and i d like in terms of the conventions to also uh you know s send a bit to dan ellis to see if it s if there s any get his input on it i don t think i don t think that ll be yeah
no
right
so maybe we should do that
yeah
not during this meeting but s another time and just get a list of everything we re gonna do
yeah
yeah
yeah
maybe n next week if we could i m trying to finish up some stuff
yeah sure i d like to
so just update all the naming conventions and
put all the files where they really belong on one disk
that sounds like a good idea
and then leave leave everything in place until the back up until the next full back up and then delete the old ones
mm hmm
now and you re just you re not talking about the s the disks the uh partitions just the backed up space or
so
well both need to be reorganized
so um
various paths th i mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way because um
i think we should also at the same time try to uh convert over to your new naming conventions
yes
exactly that too
that d be good
so that s what i was saying we need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do
yeah
and so
i didn t really get any responses from the naming conventions that i sent out so i assume that s alright with everyone
i actually haven t looked at it yet i haven t had a chance so
no
hmm
i haven t either sorry
oh
and
i will by next week though
uh i don t know about the naming i mean
then i should have made that as an agenda item
th so these names that we ve been using so far are with uh
uh
uh
i wouldn t just wanna change them
you know without some advance notice
right
i mean th that s all these segment names that we we ve been using i would rather not mess with them
yeah
yeah i m
until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently
right
dealing with so
well i mean how you choose to do it the naming is up to you
right
well
so
you re talking about different files
i mean it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you re doing but
yep
yeah i kind of agree with andreas like i m a little bit
i mean these
i looked at the naming conventions and they look fine to me but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be
well if we
if we change things it won t really affect what you re doing will it
this
no but i think just to be consistent we should also i mean have the same conventions just in case you want
right
yeah so you but you can switch that any time you want right
yeah yeah i mean it s only gonna affect my work so
yeah it s not gonna
i mean if we
i assume you re not gonna go like into you know my directories and change my file names so yeah
everybody will use it fine slash slash star
right
i actually i was gonna do a global search replace on all entries at
at icsi to change to at all places at icsi
yeah that d be great
really enjoy that
with no with no advance warning
y you
well maybe i shouldn t say that on re record
there was a
typo in some of the contracts that morgan got that someone
one of our sponsors did a global sear search and replace for between sponsor and their name
mm hmm
oh no oh no
and so it it was saying uh
well anyway i won t
yeah one one can imagine that that might be problematic
i m not sure whether that s right
yeah one can imagine the problems that that would engender
but this this name change affects a subset doesn t need to reflect everything yeah
so
right
right
um
thilo you had you wanted to talk about the
yeah i had one one short point i have just installed a transcriber version on one of our machines so it s available under windows now
oh great actually someone i just got an email this week from someone as
isn t that great
yeah i re responded to sh i have already responded to him i i don t know what what what he what the problem was it was really straightforward really easy
to anant
and this is not mm hmm
oh i m sorry i i just so who did you talk to
there was some some guy from who wanted to to install yeah
anant
anant venkataraman
yeah
and he sent an email that he couldn t couldn t install it and i i just described him well what i did and it was really straightforward so
yeah great
yeah
great great thanks thanks
and this is not just the transcriber this is the channeltrans right
yeah it s the channeltrans so the
yeah
yeah excellent
the
cool
things that dave gelbart
excellent
so you should probably talk to a sys admin and get it put in some central place
so that it ll work on all the machines
well i mean as it stands i i guess yeah i see what you mean it ll it ll be on the on the unix side but accessible through the yeah
i ve
right
yeah i could do that
so i assume tcl wasn t already on the machine so you had to install it yeah
i had i to install it yeah
huh yeah
uh
so andreas would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going
uh
oh well yeah i i i actually wasn t sure whether this is the right meeting for it because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings but
hmm
you know i did uh run
um some recognition experiments with icsi front end
um
uh and and you know this is the j joint work with chuck and uh
um
so first
uh you know we had
we figured out sometime last week how to
um
and and chuck wrote this really nice little
script perl script that
takes a uh waveform runs the feature calculation
and then dumps it out into the into um
a f c so called
uh cepstra file which is what the system uses to read features it s essentially uh
uh nist headered
uh waveform you know it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header
hmm
mm hmm
and um that s all done
um
by the script and it works great and
uh i first trained up two
systems because it s gender dep you know the system is gender dependent so to be comparable i trained uh um on a sh on a so called short training set
um
a male system and a female system
and
uh also for debugging purposes and for the heck of it i trained um
trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the front end from scratch
um and compared the two
so w what features did you use
well we used uh twelve uh uh
so not rasta just
just
just and actually that uh one of the questions i had was what the rasta would possibly buy us but um we ll
talk about that later so the uh so the baseline system w the system was uh used uh also uh uh used t twelve uh mel uh mel cepstra
um based on a twenty four filter bank
um analysis
um
i do not
know what so the f the bandwidth of the um
front end is from hundreds hertz to th th thirty se thirty seven fifty or something like that
thirty seven fifty
and i do not know what the um
icsi um
front end would do i mean what the bandwidth is
um
but the results are such that uh let s see
there s one other slight difference right or two two differences
oh yeah so the system also does um
vocal tract length normalization and we couldn t figure out how to do that yet with the icsi features so that s one difference and the other difference is that
in the uh
in the system
the uh th the first the the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest and what they do is
huh
they d they subtract the maximum
for each waveform segment
they subtract the maximum of of th over that waveform segment from
from the values of for that waveform
which is a kind of automatic gain control that is localized
do they subtract the max from each i one or do they subtract each one from the max
who cares
they subtract
doesn t matter
no just would be a sign change
except you get a lot of negatives the other way
right right right um and then after but after they done this waveform based normalization they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features
so it s their kind of two stage normalization
oh
oh
um now i understand that the common practice here has been to just do c standard uh mean subtraction um on the waveform
um
for the
right but in what we ve done so far because we didn t have any special provision for we just treat it as as any of the other features we ve done standard mean subtraction over the whole
conversation side
so
um since both and icsi use this sort of local normalization for that s presumably you know someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better
um so that s another difference and that might account for some of the
discrepancies in the results um but you know so the
the results are
um
where should i start uh
the
so there s a two
oh i tried it with and without uh
so without
and with adaptation
how many iterations
for the adaptation
mm hmm
well y we always do three iterations to
and it s it s this it s this quick and dirty
the phone loop adaptation which doesn t actually require prior recognition paths and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation but it gives you sort of a first
idea of what you could gain with it
and then you know so we have the
the front end
and the icsi front end
and other than that the system configuration was identical so it was the same
they came up with um
you know same number of uh gaussians per state cluster
um same the clustering used the same information loss threshold which actually led to roughly the same number of gaussians overall so that the system configuration is is comparable
um and the
uh so without adaptation
you had forty nine p
that s error rate or recognition rate
this is error rate
in percent
and
with adaptation
it s forty seven point one
and
this this was fifty two point six
and
fifty one point three
hmm
and then when i combined them i can actually combine them with
something like rover it s actually more sophisticated than rover but it s
um here i got
forty eight point five
and here i got forty six point five
so this is just combination at the utterance level
um
at the utterance level right
why do you think the icsi front end is so much worse
good question that s fine
that seems really odd to me
um so one percent i would attribute to the lack of about one percent
oh right right right right
ah
and then maybe another up i don t know how much the normalization business really matters i can t it see i mean can t see it the
ca can you run the just as an experiment run the front end without vocal tract norma normalization and see how much difference it makes
i could yeah
i could certainly do that yeah
um
we could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the icsi features that s something we wanted to do yeah we could i was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the s
yeah
if we could figure out how
yeah
and just try them with the icsi
uh front end because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um
to the c uh dan added the
yeah dan added that in but
yeah but the
so
they won t
they don t correspond one to one though
no but they should be
close since this
i mean the
anyway but i can certainly try the front end without uh that sh that s that s certainly quick to do
yeah
um
and so
yeah and and then there s all these um
you know the number of um
you know this front end
u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it you know how many
mm hmm
filter banks do you use what what bandwidth do you use and stuff like that and uh we could play the same kind of games with the icsi front end
right
uh actually the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role we used to use a narrow bandwidth and
uh
uh that hurt us so this is um and this is we ve now used roughly what everybody else is using so
hmm
um there s some room for improvements i figure in this in the icsi front end
um
so
but the good news is that even with this with the icsi system being that much worse you still get a win out of combining the two
so that gives some hope for the future
um
unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation so
um
also interestingly
the
um the difference actually widens i would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference because it might
um for instance
um
remove some of the um
you know som if you if you have some some difference in the front end processing that
uh is suboptimal but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the
um
moving the models around but but apparently that doesn t
doesn t really actually the difference becomes larger so
um anyway so right now what i m doing is um
uh well there s several things going on one is that chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features so that would actually be the
more interesting experiment
um the other thing is i m training
uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can
right
and i actually want to
do the system combination
um with our eval system um on some subset of the data at least probably only for the males because i don t have time to train both males and females but um
uh and um
what about ta
concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one
it gets pretty big
it does get pretty big yeah
hmm
and m my experience with that in broadcast news was usually combining at other levels works better
hmm
so
for for whatever that s worth
oh you tried that on broadcast news concatenating
oh yeah
yeah
so w yep
different feature sets yeah
did you try uh
it was mostly rasta
i see
so you know the feature sets we had available and it was almost always better to combine at the probability level you know so we d run the neural nets and combine the probabilities
i see
alright
oh
yeah and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors and that would
yep
blow up the
you d also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards
uh
so that they re uh orthogonal
right
so you d wanna do a linear transform also
right
um
so
the yeah and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the icsi front end to perform better
um and and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can i can certainly run a system without
yep
just uh to get
wi without what without
just
vocal tract thing yeah
wh yeah
and that that s quick to do
so
i was thinking about
tandem system well let s not talk about it here but i had some thoughts about the tandem system
yeah so but things are moving ahead so
should we do digits
digits sure
do we have any other topics
let s do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time
poetic reading of digits
oh no

you can really tell from the prosody where it goes
s meeting i actually have one more thing that i don t know if it s i if if it s allowed to to bring up after the dis
after digits i don t know
anyway
but it might be important for um so liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where
go ahead
it was later found that several of the
s microphones were turned off um
mm hmm
and this must become a problem especially with non speech meetings
so um
is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from
some of the channels or
probably we could probably build that in to the front end
because it you know it s really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the meetings aren t useable because uh even
what are people doing they re switching their mikes off or something
i don t know what they do maybe the batteries went dead or th they just didn t they played with the thing and it didn t leave it in the on position or whatever
i don t know uh eh fff
what would you like it to do when that happens
well no if if you um i mean obviously you always
i mean there s never gonna be a signal from all the channels right because or rarely
um
but uh
well if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out zeros you can be pretty sure it s off
right
because it doesn t spit out zeros it spits out epsilons
right cuz there s little background noise the question is when the software detects it what do you want it to do
exactly
that s a good question i don t know but is there some we can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just
i mean it it it
we we already have visual feedback right you can see whether your mike is working or not um
right
right so maybe it s just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal
yep
test
turn off the screen saver during the meeting
tell them to test their mikes or
yeah something
i think they sh
yeah i d i don t know what to do other than
it it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording
there s no sound out right now
oh
never mind
it should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting
yep yep yeah yeah that would be good well we can think about what to do about it but it
oh yeah that s a good one
wow that s not a bad idea
yeah
it s pretty clear we can detect it so
yeah alright
are we done
yeah
